This is fun! Use simple concepts to begin escaping windows restricted env.

Using simple files here, download them from either the internet onto the machine if you can run IE or open a url, save the files on the target machine.

Scenario: now access to right click, can't get to c:\ files, can't double click your vbs or bat file and many more restrictions...try these

If IE is on the desktop, drop these files on IE and then when it asks to run or save, RUN!

If IE is not on the desktop, just drag any file on your file. 

Most successful has been the bat file.
